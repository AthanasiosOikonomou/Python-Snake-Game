# Python-Snake-Game

I created this game as side project to learn how to use gui on python.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Consouldenature/Python-Snake-Game.git`
2. Run the game: `Snake.exe`
3. In the folder 'Snake Game Codes' you can find all the python codes for this game.

i. main.py is the main code file used for the game.
ii. snake.py is the snake body.
iii. food.py is the food for the snake.
iv. scoreboard.py is for keeping the score.

## How to Play

- Use arrow keys to control the snake.
- Avoid the walls and your tail.

## Future Development

- I want to add a 're-play' option
- Fix the walls
- Maybe add the option the snake to teleport thru walls
